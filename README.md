Below is extracted from this document: 


## City of Johannesburg Council - 2023-03-22/23

### COJ: Mayoral Committee - 2023-03-17

#### Johannesburg Water (SOC) LTD

For households benefiting from the Soweto Infrastructure Project in deemed consumption areas and new private developments such as Protea Glen Ext 4, Lehae, and Cosmos City, the following apply:

- A subsidized water and sanitation rising block tariff.
- A consumption-based tariff for both water and sanitation.
- Incentive-based debt write-off policy.

Customers who have prepayment meters installed qualify for a progressive monthly write-off effective from the date of meter installation, over a three-year period. Defaulting customers in terms of transgression of by-laws will have the debt write-off reversed retrospectively with interest.

- For households in informal settlements:
  - Free rudimentary Service (LOS 1) service levels
  - Free water tanker services.
  - Free vacuum tanker services

- Should a decision be made in the future to roll out the prepaid meters to all areas in the city, the prepaid tariff has to be brought in line with the conventional tariff.

- The Managing Director of Johannesburg Water will have the authority to negotiate with customers who receive a special tariff, due to older arrangements with the City, to bring these special tariffs in line with the regular tariff.

### Proposed Tariffs for the 2023/24 to 2025/26 Financial Years
